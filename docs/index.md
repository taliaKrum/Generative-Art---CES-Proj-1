# The Assignment:
The goal was to create a generative art installation as a class. Each student would write a program that would visuzalize a text of their choice on an ESP32 TTGO T-display that would be powered by a battery (we used a 500mA battery).

# My Project:
I decided to visualize some lyrics from Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. I wrote my program in the Arduino IDE and used a library called TFT_eSPI to set different text colors, fonts, text sizes and screen background colors. I also used the delay() function in order to keep the tempo of the lyrics close to that of the actual song.

# Display:
Each student put their device in a decorated paper envelope and hung it with string. The following videos show the entire display as well as my own project up close.

Installation Steps:
1. Make sure battery is charged and soldered to a JST connector so that we can power our device 
2. Once you are satisfied with your program, make sure to upload it to your ESP32
3. When the battery is connected and the program is uploaded correctly, the screen should turn on and display your program immediately 
4. Create a paper envelope to hold the ESP32 and the battery - this will be hung from the ceiling using a string when everything is ready
5. Make sure one side of the envelope stays open so that there is easy access to your device (as seen in the video below)
