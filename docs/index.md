# The Assignment:
The goal was to create a generative art installation as a class. Each student would write a program that would visuzalize a text of their choice on an ESP32 TTGO T-display that would be powered by a battery.

# My Project:
I decided to visualize some lyrics from Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. I wrote my program in the Arduino IDE and used a library called TFT_eSPI to set different text colors, fonts, text sizes and screen background colors. I also used the delay() function in order to keep the tempo of the lyrics close to that of the actual song.
