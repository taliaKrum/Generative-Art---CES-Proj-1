# Generative-Art---CES-Proj-1

Project Specs:
In this lab you will use your:  ESP32 TTGO T-display and battery. The goal is to create a generative art installation in the fifth floor Milstein. This is a collaborative installation project that we will complete as a class. We will hang everyoneâ€™s ESP32 in a small paper envelop in the hallway with the elevators. The devices will run off a battery and be up for the duration of a clas period.  From a software perspective, you will write a single ESP32 program that visualizes a text of your choice on the screen of the ESP32.

My Project:
* The two main components of the project were an ESP32 TTGO T-display and a battery which displayed some lyrics from the song Bohemian Rhapsody 
* These two parts were placed in a paper envelope that was suspended from the ceiling using a thin string
* There were around 25 projects in the whole display (one from each student in the class)
